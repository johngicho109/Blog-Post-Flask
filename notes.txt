Overall Project Description:
    The past few weeks have proven that you can learn anything. And a great way to solidify your knowledge is to teach it to other people. There is no better way to express your ideas and opinions than with a personal blog.

    Your task for this week is to create a personal blogging website where you can create and share your opinions and other users can read and comment on them. Additionally, add a feature that displays random quotes to inspire your users. 

    Use this api endpoint to help you display the random quotes.
